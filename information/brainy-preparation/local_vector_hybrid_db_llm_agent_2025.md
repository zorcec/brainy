# Local Vector & Hybrid Search Databases for LLM Agent Memory (2025)

## Practical Knowledge Base Design & Retrieval (2025)

### 1. Hybrid Search: Why and How
- **Hybrid search** combines vector similarity (semantic meaning) with keyword/tag/metadata filtering.
- Enables finding information that is both contextually relevant and matches explicit criteria (e.g., "find all notes about 'hybrid search' written in 2025 that are similar to this paragraph").
- Most effective with chunked documents, strong embeddings, and a hybrid-capable DB (Qdrant, Weaviate, pgvector, Redis).

### 2. Tagging, Linking, and Simulated Relations
- Store tags/annotations (e.g., @related, topic, author) as metadata fields for each chunk.
- Use hybrid search to filter or boost by tags, and to simulate simple relations (e.g., all chunks with @related:projectX).
- For more complex relations, encode references in metadata and recursively fetch related items.

### 3. Automatic Linking (Associative Memory)
- For each chunk, periodically run a vector search to find top-N most similar chunks (excluding itself).
- Store these as a "related" field in metadata, simulating brain-like associative links.
- Optionally, filter/boost by shared tags for more meaningful links.

### 4. Controlling Link Quantity and Quality
- Limit the number of links per chunk (e.g., top 3–10).
- Set a similarity threshold to avoid weak/irrelevant links.
- Use hybrid filters to ensure links are both semantically and contextually relevant.
- Periodically refresh links as the knowledge base grows.

### 5. Feedback-Driven Relevance (User-Guided Learning)
- Expose a feedback endpoint/tool (e.g., via MCP) to receive user feedback on links/chunks.
- On positive feedback, increase the relevance score or "bump" value for that link/chunk.
- Re-rank links so user-endorsed connections are surfaced more often.
- Optionally, decay relevance of unused links over time.

### 6. No Graph DB? No Problem
- Hybrid/vector DBs can simulate many graph-like behaviors using metadata and smart retrieval.
- For advanced traversals, supplement with a graph DB or manage relations at the application level.

_This section summarizes best practices for building a local, brain-like, feedback-adaptive knowledge base using hybrid search databases as of October 2025._

## Summary Table

| Name      | Hybrid Search | Local/Embedded | Language Support | Lightweight | VS Code/Node Friendly | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Weaviate** | Yes (vector+keyword) | Yes (Docker, Embedded) | REST, GraphQL, JS/Python | Moderate | Subprocess | Best OSS hybrid search, feature-rich |

### Weaviate: Limitations & Caveats (2025)
- **Resource Usage:** Weaviate is heavier than Qdrant or Chroma; it uses more RAM and CPU, especially with modules enabled.
- **Binary Management:** No official npm package for binary management; you must bundle, download, or instruct users to install the correct binary for each platform.
- **No Built-in Feedback Learning:** No native online learning or automatic re-ranking; all feedback-driven adaptation must be implemented in your application logic.
- **Startup Time:** Startup is slower than lighter DBs, especially with modules or large schemas.
- **No WASM/JS Embedding:** Cannot be embedded directly in browser or extension as a WASM/JS module (unlike Qdrant WASM or Chroma WASM).
- **Complexity:** More features and configuration options mean a steeper learning curve and more moving parts.
- **Module Support:** Some advanced modules (e.g., multi-modal, generative) may require extra dependencies or cloud resources.
- **Persistence:** Requires persistent storage for production use; not as lightweight for ephemeral or in-memory scenarios.

_These limitations are most relevant for lightweight, in-browser, or highly resource-constrained agent memory use cases. For advanced hybrid search and knowledge graph features, Weaviate remains a top open-source choice._

### Weaviate: Practical Integration & Binary Management Notes
- **Linux Binary Size:** The Weaviate Linux x86_64 binary is typically 80–100 MB (megabytes) per release. This is the size you can expect to download and bundle for local or subprocess use in VS Code extensions or Node.js projects.
- **NPM Package:** The official `@weaviate/client` npm package provides API access (REST/GraphQL) but does **not** manage the Weaviate server binary itself. There is currently **no npm package** that automatically downloads or manages the correct Weaviate binary for all platforms.
- **Binary Management:** For local/embedded use, you must either:
  - Download and bundle the correct Weaviate binary for each target platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) in your extension or app, or
  - Guide users to run Weaviate via Docker (if available), or
  - Write a custom script to fetch the latest binary from [Weaviate GitHub Releases](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/releases) at install time.
- **VS Code Extension Integration:** When integrating Weaviate as a subprocess in a VS Code extension:
  - Use Node.js child process APIs to launch and manage the Weaviate server.
  - Ensure the binary is present and executable for the user's platform.
  - Consider providing clear error messages and setup instructions if the binary is missing or incompatible.
- **Alternatives:** Qdrant is lighter and offers a WASM build for true in-process embedding, but Weaviate is more feature-rich for advanced hybrid/graph use cases.

_Last binary size check: October 2025_
| **Qdrant**  | Yes (vector+filter) | Yes (binary, WASM, Docker) | REST, gRPC, JS/Python | Moderate | Subprocess | Fast, Rust-based, WASM experimental |

### Qdrant: Limitations & Caveats (2025)

_These limitations are most relevant for advanced knowledge graph, multi-modal, or feedback-adaptive agent memory use cases. For lightweight, privacy-first, and local-first vector search, Qdrant remains an excellent choice._

### Qdrant: Document Relation Patterns
- **Metadata Linking:** Store related document IDs (or tags) in a metadata field (e.g., `related_ids: [id1, id2, ...]`). When you fetch a document, you can retrieve and follow these IDs to get related documents.
- **Tag-Based Relations:** Use shared tags or categories in metadata to group or relate documents (e.g., all with `topic:projectX`).
- **Associative Links:** Periodically run a vector search for each document to find top-N similar documents, then store their IDs in a `related` field for fast lookup.
- **Recursive Fetch:** To traverse relations, recursively fetch documents by following `related_ids` or tags in your application logic.
- **No Native Joins:** All relation logic (traversal, updating, etc.) must be handled in your app, as Qdrant does not support joins or graph traversals natively.

_This approach enables brain-like associative memory and simple graph traversal, but requires explicit management in your application code._
| **Chroma**  | No (vector only) | Yes (Python, WASM, JS) | Python, JS, WASM | Very light | Embeddable, WASM/JS | No true hybrid search |
| **Redis**   | Yes (vector+full-text) | Yes (binary, Docker) | JS, Python, many | Light | Node.js native | Fast, in-memory, persistence needed |
| **pgvector**| Yes (with Postgres FTS) | Yes (Postgres ext) | Any (Postgres) | Moderate | Node.js via pg | True hybrid, needs Postgres |
| **Milvus**  | Yes (vector+scalar) | Yes (Docker, binary) | Python, JS, REST | Heavier | Subprocess | Powerful, heavier for local/dev |
| **FAISS**   | No (vector only) | Yes (lib, Python/C++) | Python, C++ | Light | Not a DB | No hybrid, not a DB |

## Key Recommendations
- **Best for hybrid search, subprocess, and VS Code extension:**
  - **Qdrant** (lightweight, Rust, WASM, subprocess)
  - **Weaviate** (feature-rich, GraphQL, subprocess)
- **Best for pure vector, minimal setup:**
  - **Chroma** (JS/WASM or Python, embeddable)
- **Best for Node.js-native, hybrid, in-memory:**
  - **Redis** with RediSearch and Redis OM
- **Best for SQL/hybrid:**
  - **pgvector** (with Postgres FTS)

## Decision Notes
- **Qdrant** and **Weaviate**: Both support true hybrid search (vector + keyword/metadata), can be run as local subprocesses (good for VS Code extension), and have REST/gRPC APIs and JS clients. Qdrant is slightly lighter and has WASM support; Weaviate is more feature-rich.
- **Chroma**: Lightest and easiest for pure vector search, but lacks true hybrid search (only metadata filtering).
- **Redis**: Supports both vector and full-text search, is fast, embeddable, and has great Node.js support.
- **pgvector**: Enables hybrid search by combining vector and full-text search, but requires a Postgres instance.
- **Milvus**: Powerful and supports hybrid search, but heavier for local/dev use.
- **FAISS**: Vector index library, not a database—no hybrid search, no metadata.

## Integration Patterns
- **Subprocess Management:** Qdrant and Weaviate can be spawned as subprocesses from Node.js/VS Code extensions for local use.
- **WASM/JS Embedding:** Chroma and Qdrant (experimental) support WASM/JS for browser/extension embedding.
- **Hybrid Search:** Weaviate, Qdrant, Redis, Milvus, and pgvector (with FTS) support hybrid search (vector + keyword/metadata).
- **Pure Vector:** Chroma and FAISS are best for pure vector search without hybrid capabilities.

## Additional Notes
- For browser/extension use, WASM/JS support is key for embedding models locally.
- For lightweight, privacy-first, and local-first agent memory, Chroma and Qdrant (WASM) are most promising.
- For advanced hybrid search and knowledge graph features, Weaviate is the most feature-rich open-source option.
