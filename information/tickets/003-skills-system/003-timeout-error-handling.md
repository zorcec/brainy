## Title
Error Handling and Timeout Logic for Skills

## Context
Skills must receive clear, structured feedback for all failures, including timeouts, network issues, and provider errors. Reliable error handling is essential for safe skill development and debugging.

## Goal
Ensure all errors and timeouts in skill API calls are surfaced as structured exceptions, with consistent contracts and robust test coverage.

## Implementation Plan
- Implement timeout logic for all skill API calls (default 10s)
- Normalize and surface errors (timeout, network, provider, validation) in `errors.ts`
- Write unit tests for error mapping, propagation, and timeout logic
- Add integration tests simulating skill logic problems

## Edge Cases & Testing
- Simulate timeouts, network failures, and malformed provider responses in skill calls
- Test invalid arguments and unexpected error types from skills
- Validate error objects are consistent, informative, and match contract

## Technical Debt & Risks
- Risk: Unhandled error types or missed edge cases; mitigate with exhaustive tests and contract review
- Debt: Error contracts may need updates for new skill features or providers; track in follow-up stories

## Outcome
Skills API reliably surfaces all errors and timeouts as structured exceptions. All tests pass and error contracts are documented for skill authors.
