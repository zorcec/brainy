# Document E2E Workflow for Desktop Mode Only

## Context
With E2E tests now running exclusively in desktop (Electron) mode, clear documentation is needed to guide contributors and ensure consistent test execution and maintenance.

## Goal
Provide comprehensive documentation for running, maintaining, and extending E2E tests in desktop (Electron) mode only.

## Implementation Plan
- Write step-by-step instructions for running E2E tests in desktop mode.
- Document directory structure for desktop E2E tests.
- Explain how to add new tests for desktop mode.
- Describe how to use `npm run e2e` to run all desktop tests.
- Include troubleshooting tips and CI integration notes for desktop mode.

## Edge Cases & Testing
- Validate documentation by following steps on a clean setup.
- Ensure all contributors can run tests in desktop mode without confusion.

## Risks
- Documentation may become outdated if workflows change.
- Missed steps could lead to confusion or errors.

## Outcome
Clear, up-to-date documentation enables all contributors to run and maintain E2E tests for desktop mode confidently.
