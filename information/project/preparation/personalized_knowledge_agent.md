# Personalized Topic-Specific Knowledge Agent

## Idea Overview

This project aims to build an AI system that can learn a topic, become an expert on it, and answer questions. The system mimics human research by discovering resources, filtering relevance, validating correctness, and storing knowledge in a structured, retrievable way.

### Core Objectives
- Efficiently scrape the web for clean, usable text content.
- Gather and prioritize URLs relevant to a specific topic.
- Save content in a vector database.
- Summarize content and pick relevant resources using LLMs.
- Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for answering questions.
- Enable iterative learning and updating of the knowledge base.

## System Workflow

### 1. Input / Topic Initialization
- User provides a topic, e.g., "building efficient React web apps".
- LLM generates sub-questions to cover the topic comprehensively.

### 2. Resource Discovery
- Search for relevant URLs from:
  - Official docs
  - Blog posts, tutorials
  - GitHub repositories
  - StackOverflow threads
- Use web search APIs (Google CSE, Tavily, Exa) or curated source lists.

### 3. Fetching & Cleaning
- Fetch web pages.
- Extract clean text content, removing ads, sidebars, HTML clutter.
- Optional: language detection and irrelevant content removal.

### 4. Summarization & Relevance Filtering
- LLM creates short summaries of each page.
- Assign relevance scores based on topic/questions.
- Only top-relevant resources proceed to RAG indexing.

### 5. Chunking & Vector DB Storage
- LLM splits content into smaller, meaningful chunks.
- Store in a vector database with metadata:
  - Title
  - Source URL
  - Tags/subtopic
  - Short summary
- Suggested databases: Weaviate, Pinecone, SQLite vector extension, Milvus.

### 6. RAG Pipeline
- On user question:
  1. Retrieve top-k chunks from vector DB.
  2. LLM processes chunks + question.
  3. Produces answer with optional citations.
- If knowledge gaps are found, trigger new resource fetch (Steps 2-5).

### 7. Iterative Learning
- Update vector DB with new resources.
- Improve tagging and relevance scoring over time.
- Learn which sources are trustworthy and relevant.

## Technical Components

- **Web Scraping:** Playwright, Puppeteer, BeautifulSoup, or LLM-assisted scraping via GitHub Copilot Agent.
- **Embeddings & Vector DB:** OpenAI embeddings, HuggingFace, SQLite vector extension, Weaviate, Pinecone.
- **LLM Pipeline:** GPT-4/Claude for summarization, relevance scoring, chunking, RAG.
- **RAG:** Retrieve, augment, generate answers based on vector database.
- **Client Interface:** VS Code extension (developer-focused MVP) → web app for broader audience → MCP server backend for multi-client integration.

## Advantages
- Mimics human research and learning workflow.
- Dynamically generates sub-questions to cover a topic deeply.
- Scalable across multiple data sources (web, PDFs, GitHub, Notion, etc.).
- Persistent, reusable knowledge base.
- Potential for monetization via SaaS or premium knowledge topics.

## Potential Product Forms
1. **VS Code Extension**: Developer-focused MVP; fast validation, local storage.
2. **Web App / Browser Extension**: Collaborative topic knowledge sharing, cloud persistence, SaaS monetization.
3. **MCP Server / AI Agent Platform**: Backend engine powering multiple clients; exposes API for integration and scalability.

## Example Research Pipeline Prompt-Response Flow

**Step 1: Clarify Topic**
```
Prompt: "Research 'GraphQL caching strategies', list subtopics and relevant sources."
Response: Subtopics like server/client caching, invalidation, query batching; sources include docs, blogs, GitHub repos.
```

**Step 2: Candidate Sources**
```
Prompt: "Summarize these sources and mark actionable info."
Response: Provides summaries, relevance scores, actionable/not.
```

**Step 3: Validate**
```
Prompt: "Check for contradictions or outdated info."
Response: Highlights outdated advice, confirms valid practices.
```

**Step 4: Synthesize Knowledge**
```
Prompt: "Create structured knowledge base."
Response: Organized subtopics, best practices, examples.
```

**Step 5: Answer User Query**
```
User: "How should I cache GraphQL queries in Node.js?"
LLM: "Client-side: normalized Apollo cache; server-side: Redis; automatic invalidation via type policies; monitor cache hit/miss."
```

## Next Steps / Recommendations
- Start with a **VS Code extension MVP** focusing on local knowledge storage and RAG.
- Validate **research and relevance workflow** with 1-2 topics.
- Add web search scraping integration (Tavily, Exa, Google CSE) and automatic source summarization.
- Expand to **collaborative web app** and later **MCP server** backend for scalability and monetization.


To simulate human-like associations:

- Use semantic embeddings for fuzzy similarity.
- Build a knowledge graph for structured relationships.
- Apply contextual weighting and multi-hop retrieval.
- Introduce reinforcement and decay for “memory.”
- Combine vector + symbolic reasoning for flexible yet accurate associations.
