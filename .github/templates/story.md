## Title
<Short, action-oriented summary of the story>
> Example: Transform CSV user data into normalized JSON

## Problem
<Describe the specific problem this story should solve. Why is it important? What is the impact if not solved?>
> Example: Raw user data in CSV format contains inconsistencies (missing fields, duplicate emails, unnormalized status values) and cannot be directly consumed by downstream systems.

## Solution
<Describe the overall solution to the problem. What approach will be taken?>
> Example: Develop a process to convert the CSV file into a clean, normalized JSON array, applying data validation and transformation rules.

## Proposal
<Proposed technical solution, steps, or implementation details. Can be challenged or refined later.>
> Example:
> - Read `users.csv` with columns: `id`, `name`, `email`, `signup_date`, `status`
> - Exclude rows with missing `name` or `email`
> - Validate emails (RFC 5322)
> - Map `status`: `active` → `true`, `inactive` → `false`
> - Handle duplicate emails by keeping the first occurrence and logging duplicates
> - Output to `users.json` as an array of objects: `userId`, `fullName`, `email`, `registered`, `isActive`

## Acceptance Criteria
<List what must be true for the story to be considered “done.” How will success be measured?>
- All tests are passing.
> Example:
> - Output matches the required JSON structure
> - Invalid rows are excluded
> - Duplicate emails are logged and only the first occurrence is kept
> - All constraints are enforced
> - Input/output is well tested with sample data

## Tasks/Subtasks
<Break down the story into actionable, testable tasks. Use checkboxes for each task.>
> Example:
- [ ] Parse CSV input
- [ ] Validate and clean data
- [ ] Map status values
- [ ] Handle duplicates
- [ ] Write output to JSON
- [ ] Log processing summary

## Open Questions
<List any open questions, uncertainties, or areas needing clarification.>
> Example:
> - Are there additional fields or edge cases to consider?
> - Should logging be to file or console?

## Additional Info
<Provide any extra context, risks, affected features, testability notes, or reviewer requirements.>
> Example:
> - Example input/output provided below
> - Risks: malformed CSV, unexpected status values
> - Testability: unit tests with sample data

**Agent Instruction:**
Before starting any implementation, the agent must always parse and review the above files to ensure alignment with project principles, architecture, and development guidelines.

### Example
Input:
```
id,name,email,signup_date,status
1,Jane Doe,jane@example.com,2025-01-15,active
2,John Smith,john.smith@example.com,2025-02-10,inactive
```
Output:
```
[
  {"userId": 1, "fullName": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane@example.com", "registered": "2025-01-15", "isActive": true},
  {"userId": 2, "fullName": "John Smith", "email": "john.smith@example.com", "registered": "2025-02-10", "isActive": false}
]
```
Processing summary:
```
Processed 2 valid users.
Found 0 duplicate emails.
No rows removed due to missing or invalid data.
```
