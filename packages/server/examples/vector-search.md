# Example: Vector Search

Vector search uses machine learning embeddings to find semantically similar content.

## How It Works

1. **Text Embedding**: Convert text to numerical vectors
2. **Similarity Computation**: Calculate distance between vectors
3. **Ranking**: Return most similar results

## Benefits

- Find conceptually related content
- Works across different phrasings
- Understands context and meaning

## Example Query

```
Query: "How to improve code quality?"
Results:
- Best practices for testing
- Code review guidelines
- Refactoring techniques
```

Even though the query doesn't use exact keywords, vector search understands the semantic meaning.
