## Setup

Install dependencies for all packages:

```bash
npm install
```

## Build

Build all packages:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Test

Run unit tests (326 tests passing):

```bash
npm test
```

**Test Breakdown:**
- **Parser Tests:** 111 tests for markdown annotation and code block parsing
- **Skills Tests:** 60 tests for skill system (API, model client, session store, skill runner)
- **Extension Tests:** 4 tests for VS Code extension (2 failing due to pre-existing issues)
- **Server Tests:** 12 tests for API and database
- **Markdown Tests:** 40 tests for annotation highlighting and play button

**Skills System:**
- 19 tests for skill runner (JavaScript and TypeScript skill loading and execution)
- All skill runner tests passing ✅
- TypeScript support verified with ts-node integration

Run E2E tests:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

**E2E Tests:** Real browser automation with Playwright, launching VS Code Web and interacting with the UI
- Tests launch VS Code Web with the extension loaded
- Playwright clicks buttons, inspects decorations, and verifies output
- Uses modular fixtures for maintainable test setup and teardown
- Screenshots captured on failure in `test-results/`
- Run with `npm run e2e:headed` to see the browser in action
- See [E2E Fixtures Documentation](./packages/vscode-extension/e2e/FIXTURES.md) for details on the fixture architecture

## Development

Watch mode for tests:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Run the server directly:

```bash
node packages/server/dist/server.js
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

## Architecture

- **Server**: Node.js server with SQLite vector search for hybrid (semantic + keyword) retrieval over Markdown files
- **Extension**: VS Code extension providing integration with the Brainy knowledge assistant

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- Vitest (unit tests)
- Playwright (E2E tests)
- SQLite with vector search (better-sqlite3)
- VS Code Extension API

## Next Steps

This scaffold provides the foundation for building the Brainy knowledge assistant. 

**Completed:**
- ✅ Markdown parser for annotations, flags, and workflow definitions

**Next Phase:**

1. Code block extraction and execution context
2. Context combination and management
3. Vector embedding generation and storage
4. Hybrid search functionality
3. VS Code extension commands for indexing and searching
4. Integration between extension and server
